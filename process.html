By listening and getting to know you we’ll gain an intimate understanding of the requirements of your home. Through discussions at our studio, on-site or in your home you’ll come to know us and the Mh design philosophy. And, together, we will develop an inspired, collaborative process to realizing your vision.</p>

To establish the optimum building footprint: to address set-back requirements, to truly understand the topography features and geographic orientation of the house. Time spent together on site will inform the home’s sensitivity and integration with your natural environment.</p>

Our team will provide a square foot estimate for the Mh supplied components. The cost to finish the home can vary, based on the level of finishing materials you choose. Our budget analysis spreadsheet will guide you through the options and costs for a variety of finishes, helping you to make the optimum choices to meet your design and budget requirements.</p>

Our superstructure eliminates the requirement for load-bearing walls, providing an open plan with the opportunity to integrate extensive floor-to-ceiling windows. Roof lines are kept low and flat. The Mh roof framing system is engineered to withstand maximum wind and snow loads. Our structural engineer partner, Blackwell, reviews, and stamps the structural drawings for building permit.</p>

Optimum energy performance is achieved using high spec building components including energy efficient glazing, high R-Value insulation, and high-efficiency heating systems. Our homes exceed energy guidelines and provide great performance and efficiency.</p>

We can recommend a qualified GC or work with a contractor of your choice. The GC is involved from the ground up, being responsible for the building’s foundation; the labour to erect the Mafco framing component; and, assisting in the provision of a network of sub-trades to install electrical, mechanical and plumbing requirements. When it comes time to finish your home inside and out, the GC will provide Mh specified or your choice of finish.</p>
